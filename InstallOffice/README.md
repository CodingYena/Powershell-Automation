# InstallOffice
Installs Office 365 via powershell.

Please replace "https://path/to/OfficeSuite64BitInstaller.exe" with the actual download URL for the Office Suite 64-bit installer.

Save the script with a .ps1 extension (e.g., InstallOfficeSuite.ps1), and then run it with administrative privileges. The script will download the installer, install Microsoft Office silently using the /quiet argument, and remove the installer file once the installation is complete.

Please note that you need to have the appropriate license or subscription to Microsoft Office in order to install and use it legally.
